React elements are immutable.

HANDLING EVENTS

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. 
There are some syntax differences:
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

CONDITIONAL RENDERING

it is same way as the javascript works
